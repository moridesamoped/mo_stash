Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Solution steps
1. make a list with the Fibonacci numbers up to 4,000,000
2. you will need formula for creating this list, possibly consider a for loop to add each new number to the list of fibs
3. pull out the numbers that are divisible by 2 (def of even number) and sum
