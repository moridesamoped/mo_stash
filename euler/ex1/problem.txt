If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.

The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Solution
generate a list of all numbers below 1000
pull out all multiples of 3
pull out all multiples of 5
only add in multiples of 15 once
sum that new list
